#  First ML Project

This project consists in an application of one of the basic models of Machine Learning **(Polynomial Regression)** and Time-Series Analysis **(ARIMA)** in a real life problem, the Internet Penetration Rate's evolution in the last decade. By looking at the major influencing factors, GDP and Urbanization Rate we can get a sense of how will the technological advancement look like in the following years. 

-> All datasets were gathered from https://data.worldbank.org
